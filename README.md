## Wikipedia API

Hello and welcome, we will be exploring some functionality of the Wikipedia API. This will allow for a page to dynamically be generated based on the navbar search input.

## Setup

First, you need to setup yourself with an `API key` from the wikimedia group. Here are some instructions on how to get started [wikimedia API Portal](https://api.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). Once you get that setup make sure to create your `.env.local` file and use the import to hide your key from the public.
